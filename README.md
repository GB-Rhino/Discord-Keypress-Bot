# Overview
This project was designed to emulate Twitch-Plays-Pokemon but with friends over discord, allowing them to control keypresses.

## How it works
This bot will essentially listen to any inputs sent in any text channel on the server (RECOMMENDED YOU KEEP IT TO ONE TEXT CHANNEL) using the prefix !cmd.
the game set up in the example is Elden Ring with default keybinds.

For convenience sake, I have added functionality so that only when you are focused on the specified window does it allow inputs, preventing people from messing with your computer.

## DISCLAIMER: THIS WILL NOT RUN ON ITS OWN
You will need to supply your own bot token and install Python, as well as the prerequisites that are imported - to get the token, create a bot using the Discord developer Portal and go from there.

## Amending for other games
It is entirely possible to use this for other games. The only things you would need to change are the command map and the title of the game running on line 56.
